## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to run a simple Flutter application on an IOS iPhone Simulator. 

1. Install VSCode.
2. Install XCode. (If running on MacOS)
3. Follow the instructions to install the Flutter SDK at the link below.

## Running the app
Now that we have what we need installed, lets run the app in an iPhone simulator. 

1. Open VSCode.
2. Install the offical VSCode Flutter extension. 
3. Open the terminal in VSCode, and type 'open -a simulator'
4. Once the iPhone simulator is up and running, click 'Start Debugging' on VSCode. 
- This can be done by VSCode > Toolbar at the top > Run > Start Debugging. 
5. The application will then start and you should see the "Edit Profile Page" as the home page.
